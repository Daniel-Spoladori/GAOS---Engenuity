This project is a Operating system made in Brazil. Made by Daniel / Gato100Mal. This project is made for personal use for minecraft as specie of challenge for myself at age of 16.
for any changes or alterations i would like to be contacted but is not strictly necessary and you can edit as much as you want

sadly i didnt used github at time but i'm starting to use to save the progress so i kinda lost the progress at start and its one of my first time using github and i'm starting to learn features like automatically save
the main objetctive of this project is fun for me and for anyone that want to use it and was made a form of a challenge for see how much i can hold in a single project and i'm finishing it already.

sorry for lack of "." and "," i'll edit that later on

any doubting about this project DM me i'll love to prove it was 100% made by myself

some journey of it was saved on my instagram ('Gato100Mal')

i highly recommend using OCELOT emulator for running that OS or even the Mod itself

note: this mod was made for OpenComputers mod and thxsm for that awsome community <3



DELETE THAT FILE WHEN USING THE OS THIS IS JUST A README FILE AND CAN INPACT MEMORY USAGE IN THE OS
